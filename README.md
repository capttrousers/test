# Testing Is Fun & Good

Repo for testing experiments and test knowledge.  
For now, just a shell to get the test.js.org domain :p  


This repo could house various things related to tests:

- the classic test pyramid, in the context of software engineering, or its various progeny
- the dozens of test categories in software engineering
- expand to testing in other engineering domains, or even silly experiments
- diy testing of things like computer hardware, or electrical equipment, especially for product comparisons
- in fact software product comparisons as well
- pivot to talking about evaluating LLM outputs in the age of non deterministic behavior
- get into it with a political discussion about the nature of standardized testing in schools
